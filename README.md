TXT to CSV conversion

This script converts a tab-delimited text file into a CSV file format.  The script reads the input text file line by line, using the tab character as a delimiter to split each line into a list of values. It then writes these values as rows into a new CSV file using the csv module in Python.

This code provides a solution to convert tab-delimited text files from the MCMIS (Motor Carrier Management Information System) Catalog: Crash File into a CSV format. The catalog contains essential data about crashes involving motor carriers, and converting these files from text format to CSV makes the data more accessible for analysiis and manipulation using various tools and software.
